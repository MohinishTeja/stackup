## About The Project

![stackup-screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/prkIWQc.png)

Stackup is trying to build a better user experience for anyone in DeFi. Imagine if you wanted to earn a higher interest rate on your cash savings. With DeFi this is actually possible, but it isn't so easy compared to traditional finance.

| DeFi                                       | TradFi                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1. Configure MetaMask to work with Polygon | 1. Transfer money into a savings account |
| 2. Buy DAI with Ramp                       | ...                                      |
| 3. Use QuickSwap to get MATIC              | ...                                      |
| 4. Go on Aave and deposit DAI              | ...                                      |

The comparison above shows how much friction there currently is in the DeFi space for a use case that is suppose to be really easy to achieve. Stackup is an attempt to simplify these experiences so that anyone can have an easier time using crypto for all the DeFi use cases.

## Getting Started

Stackup is built using react native. You can follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running.

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
npm install && npx pod-install

# Run dev server
npm run start

# Launch in IOS simulator
npm run ios
```

## Roadmap

**_Stackup is currently in early development so the roadmap is TBA. You could also follow the [development blog](https://stackup.substack.com/) if you're interested in updates!_**
