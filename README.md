## About The Project

![stackup-screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/NyTeVvc.png)

Stackup is trying to build a better user experience for anyone in DeFi. Imagine if you wanted to earn a higher interest rate compared to your traditional savings account. With DeFi this is actually possible, but it isn't so easy compared to traditional finance.

| DeFi                                       | TradFi                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1. Configure MetaMask to work with Polygon | 1. Transfer money into a savings account |
| 2. Buy DAI with Ramp                       | ...                                      |
| 3. Use QuickSwap to get MATIC              | ...                                      |
| 4. Go on Aave and deposit DAI              | ...                                      |

The comparison above shows how much friction there currently is in the DeFi space for a use case that is suppose to be really easy to achieve. Stackup is an attempt to simplify these experiences so that anyone can have an easier time using crypto for all the DeFi use cases.
